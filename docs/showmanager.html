<H1>Show Manager</H1>
<P>
The Show Manager has been introduced in QLC+ starting from version 4.0.0, after forking the original QLC code on November 5th, 2012.<br>
<br>
This new feature is meant to give users the possibility to setup a time driven show in a friendly and completely graphical way.<br>
The graphic interface shows a multitrack view, typical of audio sequencers or video editing softwares, and with it users are allowed to place
QLC+ <A HREF="concept.html#Functions">Functions</A> at the desired place and time in the view.<br>
<br>
A typical use case are those gigs where bands play songs following a metronome and the light show has always to be the same, following the music.<br>
Another case are visual entertainment shows, where dancers or singers follow some music and lights create the atmosphere at the right time.<br>
<br>
The Show Manager has been studied to be used quickly and easily. Basically with just 4 steps a complete <A HREF="concept.html#Show">Show</A> can be created:

<OL>
<H3><LI>Add a new Show <IMG SRC="qrc:/show.png"></LI></H3>
First of all you need to add a new Show to the view. This creates an empty multitrack view with no tracks and no sequences, ready to be filled.<br>
A default name will be assigned by QLC+. If you don't like it, it is possible to change it with <A HREF="functionmanager.html">Function Manager</A>,
using the <A HREF="showeditor.html">Show Editor</A> panel.

<H3><LI>Add a Scene <IMG SRC="qrc:/scene.png"></LI></H3>
In the Show Manager, a Scene corresponds to a track. When you add a Scene, a popup will ask you to select an existing Scene
or to create a new one with a default name.<br>
When done, a new track will be created. All the sequences created on this track
will act only on the associated Scene, not affecting all the other tracks.<br>
A newly created track will be set automatically as active. An active track has a green light on the left side.<br>
Once selected, a track will display its <A HREF="sceneeditor.html">Scene Editor</A> on the bottom of the screen.

<H3><LI>Add a Sequence <IMG SRC="qrc:/sequence.png"></LI></H3>
When a track has been activated, it is possible to add a <A HREF="concept.html#Sequence">Sequence</A> to it.<br>
A new sequence will be placed at the cursor position, but it is always possible to move it to the desired time
just by dragging it along the timeline.<br>
A sequence cannot be moved to another track, since it is bounded to the track where it has originally been created.<br>
Once selected, a sequence will display its <A HREF="chasereditor.html">Chaser Editor</A> on the right side of the screen.

<H3><LI>Add some steps <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_add.png"></LI></H3>
Once a sequence has been created, it is now the time to add steps to it.<br>
When modifying a step duration, fade in or fade out, you will see the sequence changing on the multitrack view,
giving an immediate feedback for aligning to other sequences or certain points in time.

</OL>
<br>
To increase the complexity of the Show, more scenes can be added. Just repeat steps 2, 3 and 4.
