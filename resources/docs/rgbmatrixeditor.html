    <LI><B>Static</B> - the image is statically displayed on the matrix. If the image is smaller than the matrix, 
     it is repeated in both directions. (Tip: for stripes, use 1-point-high images)</LI>
    <LI><B>Horizontal</B> - the image is scrolled horizontaly. Again, image is repeated in both directions.</LI>
    <LI><B>Vertical</B> - same as <B>Horizontal</B>, but in vertical direction.</LI>
    <LI><B>Animation</B> - play animation. Stack the frames (of width equal to matrix's) side by side in one image.
     For example, when matrix is 8x8 and you want to have 4 frames, make image 32x8. The image is still repeated
     vertically.</LI>
