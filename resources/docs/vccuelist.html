<P>
A Cue List provides a list of <A HREF="file:concept.html#Functions">Functions</A> that
you can step through with a single keyboard key. The Cue List is designed for
theatrical performances where the lighting operator needs only to follow the script
and toggle the next cue as the performance goes on.
</P>

<P>
The first column on the Cue List displays the step (cue) number that runs from 1 to
infinity and beyond <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Lightyear">.</A>
The second column shows the individual <A HREF="file:concept.html#Functions">Function</A>
name that has been assigned to that particular cue.
</P>

<P>
<b>Please note</b> that only <A HREF="file:concept.html#Chaser">Chasers</A> 
can be assigned to a Cue List, for the simple reason that the Chaser 
is the only function with a duration. Since any other Function can be added
as a step to a Chaser with the <A HREF="file:chasereditor.html">Chaser Editor</A>,
it is simple to create the desired Cues by mixing <A HREF="file:concept.html#Scene">Scenes</A>, 
<A HREF="file:concept.html#Collection">Collections</A>, and so on...
</P>

Cue Lists can be configured with the object properties button

   is stopped at any step in the list.<br>
   The possible choices are:
   <UL>
    <LI>Run chaser from first/last step (default): This is the default behaviour and it will run the Chaser

    <LI>Run chaser from next/previous step: Start the Chaser from the step where it has been interrupted</LI>
    <LI>Select next/previous step: This performs only a selection of a step, without running the Chaser</LI>
    <LI>Do nothing: No action is taken in this case. This is useful when working only with the Play/Stop button</LI>

When switching QLC+ to <A HREF="file:concept.html#Modes">Operate Mode</A>, the Cue List will
become active, allowing the selection of the desired steps included in the associated Chaser.<br>
Pressing the ENTER key will start the selected step.<br><br>

   be colored in <span style="background-color:#63C10B">green</span>.<br>
   During the hold time the bar will be colored in <span style="background-color:#0F9BEC">blue</span>.
   The text displayed on the bar is the time remaining for the cue to end.<br>
   If the step duration is set to inifinite (&infin;), the bar will just display the fade in progress

</TABLE>

</P>

<br>
<H3>Crossfade</H3>

<P>
  There are two faders that can be used to manually control crossfade between two consecutive steps.<br><br>
  Each slider is connected to a Cue List step and to help to understand their purpose we'll call them 
  "current step" and "next step" sliders.<br>
  The label at the bottom of each slider will show
  the number of the step that the slider is controlling and a color to show the status of that step.<br><br>
  The checkbox at the top will link the sliders together to facilitate crossfading between steps.<br>
  When the Cue list is running the sliders control the intensity of the 
  associated steps, overriding their Fade In and Fade Out speeds and so allowing manual control
  of the transition.<br><br>
  The slider for the <span style="background-color:#4E8DDE">current step</span> has a blue label. This will be at 100% when the replay of the Cue List is started.<br>
  The slider for the next step</span> has an <span style="background-color:orange">orange label</span> and will be at 0% when the replay of the Cue List is started.<br>
  The intensities of both steps can be adjusted by moving the corresponding slider.<br><br>
  However, after both sliders have been moved to the opposite ends of their travel, the following changes take place:<br>
  The orange <span style="background-color:orange">next step</span> label changes to <span style="background-color:#4E8DDE">blue</span> (slider at 100%). This indicates that the old next step has become the new current step.<br>
  The blue <span style="background-color:#4E8DDE">current step</span> label changes to <span style="background-color:orange">orange</span> and the number of the step is increased by 2 (slider at 0%). So this slider now controls the step which comes after the
  old next step.
</P>

<br>
<H3>Hint</H3>

<P>
When a step is added to a Chaser using the <A HREF="file:chasereditor.html">Chaser Editor</A>, the default 
duration is set to 0.<br>
To avoid the steps in the Cue List looping frantically without any result, set the duration
of your steps, either by double clicking on the duration field or by using the 
Speed Dial widget<IMG src="qrc:/speed.png"><br>
Note that if you need scenes that you're going to crossfade manually with the 
Cue List widget, you probably will want to set the duration of the steps to "infinite" (&infin;) using the Speed Dial widget. This can be
enabled in the Chaser Editor by clicking on the <IMG src="qrc:/speed.png"> button.
